              only worry's. No bills, no pains in the morning when you wake up
              and if nothing hurts your are probably dead.

              I am a geek or maybe I am a nerd. Who knows but I admit that I
              love SciFi and some time I love to dress up. Geek – An enthusiast
              of a particular topic or field. Geeks are collection oriented,
              gathering facts and mementos related to their subject of interest.
              They are obsessed with the newest, coolest, trendiest things that
              their subject has to offer. Nerd – A studious intellectual,
              although again of a particular topic or field. Nerds are
              “achievement” oriented, and focus their efforts on acquiring
              knowledge and skill over trivia and memorabilia.

              I am not a poet or play writer, hence "experiment" in the title.
              It is a mix between Purimshpill and white poetry. Many years ago I
              got fascinated by the story of Khazar's tribes that converted to
              Judaism around 9th century. I felt like I need to tell that story.
